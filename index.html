	<p>I would like to get into the computer industry through networking and eventually pursuing coding and computer science jobs. My current goal is to achieve multiple networking certifications and get experience in multiple coding languages.</p>
	<p>I was born in River Falls, Wisconsin but moved to Duluth/Superior very early in my life. When I was five, my family moved to Pinetop-Lakeside, Arizona where I spent most of my childhood outside hiking and catching bugs and reptiles. After living in Arizona for a few years, my family decided to move back to Minnesota where the rest of our family lived. As a teenager I spent much of my time playing video games on the family computer, often modding games and sometimes creating and writing my own mods in Python or Java. I also spent time playing hockey with friends and participating in my schoolâ€™s cross country running team.</p>
